        Hello,
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to meet with me and give me some quick feedback. Having access to such a great mentor who gives advice in real-time has truly helped me advance my skills as a professional. Whenever I'm unsure of how to move forward in a situation, I know I can depend on you to be honest about my performance. I'm excited to continue learning more from you in the future.
        </p>

            Best,
            Forrest
